# [Distributed statistical inference with `pyhf`](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1019958/contributions/4418598/)

Jupyter notebook talk given at [PyHEP 2021](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1019958/) on distributed statistical inference with `pyhf`

## Setup

In a Python virtual environment run the following

```console
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
python -m pip install -r binder/requirements.txt
```

### Globus account

To use `funcX` requires the use of [Gloubs](https://www.globus.org/) and so will require you to first login to a Globus account to use the `funcx-sdk`. Globus allows authentication through existing organizational logins or through Google accounts or [ORCID iD](https://orcid.org/) so this shouldn't be a barrier to use.
